  Machine Coding
  
**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

Create a snake and ladder application. The application should take as input from the command line.

    Number of snakes (s) followed by s lines each containing 2 numbers denoting the head and tail positions of the snake.
    
    Number of ladders (l) followed by l lines each containing 2 numbers denoting the start and end positions of the ladder.
    
    Number of players (p) followed by p lines each containing a name.
    
After taking these inputs, you should print all the moves in the form of the **current player name** followed by a **random number between 1 to 6*NoOfDices** denoting the die roll and the initial and final position based on the move.

**Format: <player_name> rolled a <dice_value> and moved from <initial_position> to <final_position>**
