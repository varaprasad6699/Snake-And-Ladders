# Snake-And-Ladders
  Machine Coding
  
**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

Create a snake and ladder application. The application should take as input from the command line.

    Number of snakes (s) followed by s lines each containing 2 numbers denoting the head and tail positions of the snake.
    
    Number of ladders (l) followed by l lines each containing 2 numbers denoting the start and end positions of the ladder.
    
    Number of players (p) followed by p lines each containing a name.
    
After taking these inputs, you should print all the moves in the form of the **current player name** followed by a **random number between 1 to 6*NoOfDices** denoting the die roll and the initial and final position based on the move.

**Format: <player_name> rolled a <dice_value> and moved from <initial_position> to <final_position>**

When someone wins the game, print that the player won the game.

**Format: <player_name> congrats you won the game.**

**Rules of the game**

The board will have 100 cells numbered from 1 to 100.

The game will have a six sided dice numbered from 1 to 6 and will always give a random number on rolling it.

Each player has a piece which is initially kept outside the board (i.e., at position 0).

when each player gets his turn he will roll a dice which gives a random number from 1 to 6 and based on the number he will move to the next_position.

In between the cells there are snakes and ladders.

Snake will have a head and tail and head is always have greater value than tail.

Ladder will have a start and end position and start position will have low value than end.

Whenever a player ends up at a position with the head of the snake, the player should go down to the position of the tail of that snake.

Whenever a player ends up at a position with the start of the ladder, the player should go up to the position of the end of that ladder.

**Optional Requirements**

The game is played with two dice instead of 1 and so the total dice value could be between 2 to 12 in a single move.

The board size can be customizable and can be taken as input before other input (snakes, ladders, players).

On getting a 6, you get another turn and on getting 3 consecutive 6s, all the three of those get cancelled.
